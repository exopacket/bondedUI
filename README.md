# bondedUI ⚛️

<b>a full stack framework that's the perfect bond between client side & server side.</b> 

This is a side project and will take some time. Most of the working files are in the build directory. Eventually, bondedUI will be used as the framework used for building code with Aloft. Aloft is in a separate repo and is a new programming language with powerful and simple syntax that I'm creating to make writing web applications crazy easy.<br>

Bonded will mimic a one page application using the browser's history API, but every page can be loaded and rendered normally on the server side with the url of the PHP page.

<br>When complete this repo will also contain a component viewer, editor, and PHP component generator to use with the larger PHP framework that combines the client side and server side processes into one code base. Vue.js will still be used, however, you will import the Vue.js components and use them as PHP components.

The purpose of this is to quickly produce web applications using PHP as a full stack framework.

<b>Think SwiftUI or Flutter! .. but for PHP </b>

Currently parts of the tailwind ui kit, bootstrap, and tablr ui kit are being used for the built PHP components. (Hopefully) when complete there will be a collection of PHP elements that were created around Vue.js or with bonded's internal elements which you'll select to include in your "Application", and then simply write the client side and server side code with one file or a set of files. This will help you write web applications with better SEO, security, page loading times, and enhance the overall simplicity of writing and using a web application.
