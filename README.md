# bondedUI ⚛️

<b>a full stack framework that's the perfect bond between client side & server side.</b> 

This is a side project and will take some time. It's currently a mess of files..<br>

<b>The code as it is currently does not work. Check out the syntax to get familiar before the release and documentation.</b>

<br>When complete this repo will contain a component viewer, editor, and PHP component generator to use with the larger PHP framework that combines the client side and server side processes into one code base. Vue.js will still be used, however, you will import the Vue.js components and use them as PHP components.

The purpose of this is to quickly produce web applications using PHP as a full stack framework.

<b>Think SwiftUI or Flutter! .. but for PHP </b>

Currently the tailwind ui kit is being used for the built PHP components. (Hopefully) when complete there will be a collection of PHP elements that were created around Vue.js, you'll select the ones to include in your "Application", and then simply write the client side and server side code with one file. This will help you write web applications with better SEO, security, page loading times, and the overall simplicity of writing and using a web application.
