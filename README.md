# bondedUI

<b>the perfect bond between client side & server side.</b>

This is a side project and will take some time. It's currently a mess of files..

<br><br>When complete this repo will contain a Vue.js component viewer, editor, and PHP component generator to use with the larger PHP framework that combines the client side and server side processes into one code base.

The purpose of this is to quickly produce web applications using the Vue.js framework and PHP together.

<b>Think SwiftUI or Flutter! .. but for PHP </b>

Currently the tailwind ui kit is being used.
